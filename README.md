## ‚ö†Ô∏è Conflict Handling (Editing Notes)

- In the `notes` table, each row has an `updated_at` timestamp column.  
- When a user opens a note for editing, the current `updated_at` value is sent along with the form.  
- When saving:
  1. The app fetches the latest `updated_at` from the database.  
  2. If it matches the one the user had when they started editing ‚Üí save is allowed.  
  3. If it does not match ‚Üí conflict is detected.  

In case of conflict, the user sees:
- Their own unsaved changes (so they don‚Äôt lose what they typed).  
- The latest version of the note from the database.  

This allows the user to manually merge or reapply their changes instead of silently overwriting someone else‚Äôs edits.
